## Let's build tic-tac-toe!

To run the project

```
npm start
```

This will open a tab in your browser at http://localhost:3003.

If you want to use another port instead of 3003, on `package.json`, modify

```json
"start": "PORT=3003 react-scripts start",
```

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._
